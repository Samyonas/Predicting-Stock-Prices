Stock Price Prediction with XGBRegressor
Project Summary
This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using machine learning techniques. By training an XGBRegressor model on historical stock data, we aim to create an effective system for forecasting stock closing prices. The project highlights how gradient boosting algorithms can be applied to time-series financial data to make informed predictions.

Main Features
Full data preprocessing including handling missing data and engineering features (e.g., lag values, time-based features).

Application of XGBoost's Regressor for stock price prediction.

Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²).

Visualization of prediction results against real data.

Exporting and reloading the trained model for future use.

Tools and Libraries
Python 3

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

XGBoost (XGBRegressor)

Project Pipeline
Data Acquisition

Downloaded historical stock data from [mention your source like Yahoo Finan].

Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Managed missing data and created additional features such as moving averages and lagged closing prices.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Model Building

Trained an XGBRegressor model using the processed dataset.

Tuned hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.

Model Evaluation

Assessed model performance using regression evaluation metrics.

Visualization

Plotted the actual and predicted stock prices for easy comparison and analysis.

Model Saving

Stored the trained model with joblib for quick future predictions.

Getting Started
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-xgb.git
cd stock-price-prediction-xgb
Install all required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Execute the main script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Load the saved model for future predictions:

python
Copy
Edit
import joblib
model = joblib.load('xgb_stock_model.pkl')
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
Project Outcomes
The model achieved an R² score of [insert your value] on unseen data.

The model demonstrated strong predictive capability by closely tracking market price movements.

Potential Enhancements
Integrate additional technical indicators like MACD, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.

Compare performance with other models like LSTM or ARIMA.

Deploy the solution using a lightweight web app built with Streamlit or Flask
